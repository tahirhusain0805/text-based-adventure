# TITLE
Text-Based Adventure

# Overview and Description
I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to learn and expand upon my knowledge about data structures - graphs and stacks in particular. This project simulates a branching narrative where players make decisions at each step of their adventure. The game is structured as a decision tree, where each choice leads to a new decision point, eventually determining the player's fate. The game is implemented in Java, and the underlying structure utilizes graphs and stacks to manage the player's choices and allow for backtracking. Maps are used to represent the structure of a graph and store decisions alongside their corresponding choices. Stacks allow the user to return to their previous choice/decision.

# How to Run This Project
1. Download the project to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory 
3. Compile the code using a Java compiler and run the game using the java command

# How to Play
You'll be presented with a prompt and a list of choices. Enter the number corresponding to your choice and if you wish to go back to the previous choice, type 0. Continue making choices until you reach an ending. The game includes multiple endings - successful and otherwise so experiment with different paths to explore a range of outcomes.

# Potential Future Enhancements
- Graphical Interface: Implement a GUI (using JavaFX or a web interface) to make the game more interactive and visually engaging.
- Save/Load Feature: Allow players to save their progress and pick up where they left off.
- Expand the Story: Add more branching paths and decisions to increase the gameâ€™s replay value.
